Some Examples of Framework Usage
================================

Here are some examples of cool things I've done.


Mininet Topologies
------------------

You can select one to be used.

.. figure::  ../images/fail.png
   :scale: 20 %

   An example.

.. note::
   This example creates a Mininet net object.

.. automodule:: thesis.experiments.topos.diamond

.. autoclass:: thesis.experiments.topos.diamond.DiamondTopo
   :members:


Objective Functions
-------------------

Same here, there are a number available such as shortest_path which you can choose.

* shortest_path
* max_spare_capacity
* widest_shortest_path


Experiment Scripts
------------------

Here you can do whatever you like.

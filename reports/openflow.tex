\chapter{OpenFlow Protocol}
OpenFlow \cite{onf:switch140} is a protocol for communication between switches and a controller. It is based on the existing concept of match-action pairs at different levels of granularity \cite{mckeown:sdn}. The developers identified the set of actions that that most switch vendors had in common. The set is extensible, but there is a minimum requirement that all switches must meet: forward packets to a port, encapsulate packets and send to controller, or drop packets. All switches must also provide some method of separating production traffic from experimental, either by running separate VLANs or by implementing an additional action.

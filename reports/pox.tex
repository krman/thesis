\chapter{POX Controller Framework}
There are a number of controller frameworks today which allow programmers to send OpenFlow messages to switches in the network; selection in the first case is based on familiarity with the development language used. One such framework, based on Python, is POX \cite{onl:pox}, developed at Stanford primarily for ease of research over speed and performance. This is acceptable if performance of the network is not bound by the controller, at least for initial development; this can be verified if necessary.

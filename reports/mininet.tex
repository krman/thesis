\chapter{Mininet Network Emulator}
Mininet is a network emulator which uses container-based emulation \cite{handigol:mininet} to create a virtual network of hosts and switches. Mininet makes it simple to run reproducible network experiments under realistic conditions, with topologies and behaviour programmable in Python. The resources allocated to each host can be controlled and monitored, and benchmarking \cite{handigol:benchmarks} has generally shown that the performance and timing characteristics are accurate. OpenFlow-enabled switches such as OpenVSwitch can be used in the simulations so the system is ideal for SDN research.

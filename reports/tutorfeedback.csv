What aspects of any tutor's approach to teaching best helped your learning?,What would you have liked any of the tutors to have done differently?
Helpful and gave sound advice,
Helpful,
Person2 was patient and helped me learn a lot,person1 really confuses me when he explains things
The sessions at the beginning of each tute were extremely helpful. While assignment help is important as well. I found these especially good. I found Pat to be especially well mannered.,
They were very approachable and helpful. Well organised and good at explaining,
Best goat wrestler. Alway good for a round of curling,more hats please
Stephen – always willing to go the extra mile – legend,
"Very active on newsgroups, was very helpful. Numerous tutors very hands on in tutorials, gave quick access to help",Nil
Innovative,Demonstration and give more examples on assignment.
Patience. One tute ran 30 mins over and he stayed to ensure I got my 5 minutes of questions.,"Because JF, hadn't specified the tutes needed content some weeks, I came along from work to sit in a room with 20 PCs for an hour. I was paying around $40 for the priviledge as well as missing out on $50 wages."
Stephen was very good at explaining things. He always gave useful hints without just giving the answer,Nothing
Patrick was a very helpful tutor – he always gave useful suggestions and was happy to help with any issue,
"Steve mate! Bloody legend. Pat, you were so great man. Serious, you two guys were top blokes.",
Pat was very good explaining and putting up with my bad questions,
Patrick was very friendly,
PJL was too awesome for this course explained and showed methods that were great.  Steve was a great bloke,Nothing
Tutors dedicated lots of time to helping and were very patient,
"Pat awesome tutor, very very will prepared",
"Pat – fantastic tutor, great explanations",
Really good teaching style patrick,
Super dedicated to helping students and to posting / helping students on the discussion board. Eg tutors answering posts at odd times. - Sick lads till next time. - Best tutors for any course I ever had.,Nothing
"Breaking down the assignment when explaining it, explaining key concepts and bigger picture ideas to give holistic understanding.  Drawing easy to understand diagrams",more tutors. Have a better system of answering questions. Explain what it is we are meant to do in tutorials rather than ambiguous words on the whiteboard and expect us to know what to do – if we just ask general questions about an assignment say that explicitly.
Visuals to help reinforce tough concepts – Tutors suggesting methods / techniques to simplify coding problems,
Discussion board access to tutors is great,
Going through exercises and examples at tutorials (Pat),
He had some really helpful newsgroup posts and example code,person1 was fine
Very clear and easy to understand demonstrations of the assignments (Pat),
"Simon Shaw : well explained skill, kind",
Special thankyou to Joel Addison for being on the facebook group.  Simon's enthusiasm,
Joel: He's just a great teacher. Simon: Super smart but needs to stop being upset with retards in the course,
,"I was scheduled for person3's tutorial session, but <they> never taught anything, so I went to another session instead"
Simon be awesome,
Most tutors: the amount of time and effort devoted to helping students was outstanding,
Enthusiasm – Empathy – preparation – eg of common problems student faced / things they were stuck on,
Simon / Pat / Joel A stepping through problems on the board really helped me visualise the problem at hand. Joel really payed close attention to how much I was struggling and put in more effort than was required so I am very grateful for that.,More Wizards
"Simon is good, Joel is such a nerd but good at explaining",
They spent heaps of time outside class hours helping. All were very knowledgable and friendly. There was a real sense of cohension between everyone – no tutors really had the wrong idea of how things worked.,A bit more example code uploaded would be good but otherwise fantastic!
Bec and Jaco teach something at the tutorials please?,
,Nothing was taught by tutors in tutorials or pracs when there was supposed to be teaching material.   Basically: to hovetaught me something
Joel – went above and beyond to help students; showed a comprehensive understanding of course content.   Jaco – patient and thorough help given.   Simon – superior tutor! Simon is one of the best ITEE tutors I've had – he explained concepts in a clear manner and above and beyond to help students. His theory tutes were invaluable.   Ye- always patient and helpful  - obviously has very thorough knowledge of course content,
"Simon is incredibly smart and the most helpful tutor I've ever had, his Friday Workshops are been phenomneal places to learn.  I found person5 very unapproachable and seemingly condescending.    My rostered tutors and practical tutors were person5 and Person4 and I found them very uninformative.  They taught the content very poorly if there was anything to teach.",All written above
All tutors were approachable and could answer most questions,slightly more coverage code based content covered in lectures
"uniformly attentive, helpful and respectful",
tutors were great dedicated and spent a lot of time helping students eg with assignments,nothing
"Simon , best tutor I've ever had, kept it up. You are amazing at explaining things and always spend the time helping people if needed",
The tutors activity on the newsgroup was a shock to me I have never had such an involved group of tutors in a course. Keep it up!,I don't think they could improveon their helpfulness
,"Spend more time on each student in each pass through the room, some tutors are okay but some have room for improvement"
,To acknowledge that sherlock cat private eye is a thing
"If I didn't understand something, the explained it to me until I understood. They were very approachable","Nothing, the tutors were great"
Interactive approach when answering questions.  Tutors were amazing on forums,
Joel is a mad kid. Very helpful person. Always good at explaining things,
Most relentless 'turbo worksite rave' I have ver seen in my life. <expletive>,More aviators <we believe this is a reference to sunglasses>
Woah there were girls in this course?,
"get some sun, you are all too pale.",
He was very helpful with helping me find problems in my assignments while still letting me find the solutions myself. <Joel was the only tutor with marks so I assume they were talking about him>,Seemed good to me
"Joel, simon and Kim were all very helpful, knowledeable and understanding",
Person6 is a hottie.  Simon is a wizard Joel is a wizard Jr.,Person6 – be less hot.  Simon – be more wizardy. Joel = N.A
"Two ways communicating, writing on the whiteboard",I would like the tutor to help more in choosing the proper function to be use for one specific part.
"Only went to a few tutes, tutors were very helpful",
Tutors were extremely patient and dedicated significantly more of their time than those in other course I've taken,
Simon – you are a boss! Great at explaining things,
They were always willing to help. Support via newsgroups / irc / extra tutes was excellent,
The dedication of the tutors was astounding. Simon answered questions on the newsgroups at 1.30am. WHO DOES THAT? Joel and Simon were outstanding.,
,Person5 All <he/she> does is 'Go read the man pages'.  Simon was helpful but he doesn't do the whole program for you. Helps in letting students understand more :)  <They may have mixed up negative and positive there>
Patrick is Good. Ding too.,They are generally nice and good tutes
Attention,
All tutors were well organised and very helpful,"Some sections, certain tutors went through some programming materials as if they were teaching. It would be good if this happened during every section"
Simon was friendly and very helpful. I also found Joel's contributions on the news group exceptional,
Patrick and Joel's epic use of the whiteboard,
,more structured tutorials with more consistent with each tutorial time
Sharing algorithm is pretty useful,

All tutors are approachable and very experienced in their knowledge,
All tutors were fantastic for this course the amount of time they made available to us to help with assignments was invaluable they were always ready to answer any questions.,
"Person7 was awesome as always. Person8 provided very good help and explained things, so that they were easily interprited. Person9 also provided very clear and helpful advice, For <their> sake one hopes <they> isn't hit on too much.",
"Simon's jovial attitude was awesome, he was also extremely willing to help at anytime. Great guy and great tutor.",
"Joel Addison, the voice of an angel, you were the best!  Simon, your swag levels were over 9000, tone it down a bit man.  Jaco, thanks for all the help!   Thanks you so much to all of the tutors! You were all very approachable and superhelpful. You made this semester awesome!",
Explaination of course work. Joel Addison's voice of an angel / <can't read this bit> Simon's wittyness. Jaco great explaination of the work. Kim being able to show different approach to work. Rebecca always helping with everything.,To drink less coffee. To kick people out of the room who weren't in the course.
"Demonstrations, explanations. Very Helpful!",
,KFC!
Simon and Joel very helpful explained everything clearly,
,Teaching programming approach in small groups. I often waited +1hrs to ask questions ad answers usually didn't help much ? although cannot expect tutors to find code error by looking at it for a few minutes
Simon – absolutely fantastic ? perfect explanations on a simple + advanced level. Pat – Humo <yes that's what it says>,
Very helpful. Pat's code examples were good. As were Simon's and Joel's. Stephen was always helpful and taught me a lot,
Being really active on facebook and newsgroup,Too sexy and distracting <No indication who this refers to>

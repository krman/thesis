\chapter{Abstract}

Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a new concept in networking, that has the potential to fundamentally change how networks are deployed, configured and maintained, as well as how network protocols are designed and implemented. The goal of this project is to explore the concept of this new technology, by implementing a basic routing protocol on an SDN framework.

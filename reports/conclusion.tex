\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:conclusion}

The framework was produced with as little boilerplate as possible required. The framework is supported by a set of objective functions and Mininet topologies (all the ones discussed in this report), as well as sample experiment scripts used to produce the graphs, and various helper functions. Where possible automated tests have been provided, and code coverage is approximately 42\%. Documentation in the form of a user guide and API reference have also been produced and are available on the companion disk.

Much analysis was made. This analysis was intended to be primarily to test ease of use of the software, and indeed these efforts identified improvements to the way the system worked which were implemented. However, maybe, this research also resulted in some significant findings with regard to objective functions, maybe. These findings are discussed in Chapter \ref{ch:discussion} of this report, and will be presented at the student workshop in December 2014.

Overall the project has been a smashing success with all deliverables produced in advance of the deadline. The project source is licenced under the Apache 2.0 licence and will be made available publicly after assessment for this course is finalised.

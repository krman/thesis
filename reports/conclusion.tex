\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:conclusion}

The framework was produced with as little boilerplate as possible required. worst intro sentence ever. The framework is supported by a set of objective functions and Mininet topologies (all the ones discussed in this report), as well as sample experiment scripts used to produce the graphs, and various helper functions. Documentation in the form of a user guide and API reference have also been produced and are available on the companion disk. this is actually mostly not a lie.

Much analysis was made. This analysis was intended to be primarily to test ease of use of the software, and indeed these efforts identified improvements to the way the system worked which were implemented. generally i guess it was better with the complicated routing stuff, but this only really became apparent when the network was congested a lot etc etc. widest path did pretty well as well for less than that. kind of all as expected i guess.

Overall the project has been a smashing success with all deliverables produced in advance of the deadline. of course.

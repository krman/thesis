\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my supervisor A/Prof Marius Portmann for his consistent encouragement and support of this thesis, as well as the flexibility he gave me in setting a direction for this work which matched my interests. I also thank my work colleagues for their instructive comments about the practical applications of this field, and my friends for providing welcome distraction at (mostly) the right times.
